                <h4>The Story of the "All-American" B-17, a Smooth Landing</h4>
                <p>
                    We got this email in our inbox the other day, purporting to tell the story of
                    the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, “All American.” The story, accompanied with
                    some incredible pictures, told of the plane, mortally wounded, getting her
                    crew home safely.

                    We were pretty sure we had seen this email, sent from a
                    friend (who got it from a friend, who got it from a friend, ad infinitum)
                    before at some time in the past, but reading it over, some things about the
                    chain email just didn’t make sense, so we decided to do some research.

                <h4>See This WWII Pilot Fly His Dream Aircraft</h4>
                <p>
                    As everyone will be well aware, from our previous reporting, the Hawker Typhoon
                    Preservation Group has been working hard to restore Hawker Typhoon Mk.IB RB396
                    back to flying condition, using a significant amount of original material from
                    this aircraft, which force-landed in the Netherlands during the closing stages
                    of WWII.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The organization is dedicated to preserving the legacy of those many
                    unsung heroes who built, flew and maintained Hawker’s iconic fighter/ground
                    attack aircraft and, as part of this effort, they have been highlighting the
                    stories of WWII Typhoon pilots. One such event took place recently, on October
                    3rd, 2020, when the Hawker Typhoon Preservation Group organized a remarkable
                    flight for Bernard Gardiner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gardiner is one of the last remaining WWII Hawker Typhoon pilots and a
                    strong supporter of the project to rebuild RB396. He flew the Hurricane and
                    Typhoon during the war, but one aircraft eluded him – the Spitfire. Bernard
                    originally joined the Royal Air Force on October 3rd, 1940, while the Battle of
                    Britain raged overhead. Now, almost exactly 80 years later, the Hawker Typhoon
                    Preservation Group (HTPG) arranged something incredibly special for him
